This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in COBOL programs: arithmetic overflow. The program adds 1 to WS-AREA-1 and then adds WS-AREA-1 to WS-AREA-2, displaying the result.  If the result exceeds the maximum value for a 9(5) field, it will silently overflow, leading to incorrect results. The solution demonstrates how to handle this by checking for potential overflows before performing the arithmetic operations and including error handling.
